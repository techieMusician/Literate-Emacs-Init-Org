#+title: My Emacs Configuration Orgfile
* Intention
This is my (admitedly) newest attempt at:
1. Creating my own emacs configuration from scratch
2. Get myself to use methods of planning and structure to allow myself to accomlish goals
* Welcome

Here is my configuration. This file creates an init.el which is loaded by Emacs at startup.


* Configure Babel Languages

To execute or export code make sure to load languages.  Setup =org-babel-load-languages= for each language to use 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((emacs-lisp .t)
     (python . t)
     (shell . t)))

  (push '("conf-unix" . conf-unix) org-src-lang-modes)
#+end_src

:Results:
#+RESULTS:
: ((conf-unix . conf-unix) (C . c) (C++ . c++) (asymptote . asy) (bash . sh) (beamer . latex) (calc . fundamental) (cpp . c++) (ditaa . artist) (dot . fundamental) (elisp . emacs-lisp) (ocaml . tuareg) (screen . shell-script) (shell . sh) (sqlite . sql))
